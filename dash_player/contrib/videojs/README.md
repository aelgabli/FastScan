# videojs-tech-dashjs

An integration of [Video.js](http://videojs.com) and [Dash.js](https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js).

For Video.js, this adds support for MPEG-DASH in browsers that support the Media Source Extensions.

For Dash.js, this gives access to all of the [Video.js plugins](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/wiki/Plugins), [custom skinnning](http://designer.videojs.com), and support for falling back to other video formats (HLS/MP4/Webm) through other technologies (HTML5/Flash/Youtube).

See the included example.html for a demo of how to use this project.
